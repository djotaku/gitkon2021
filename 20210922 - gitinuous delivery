git and continous delivery is a great way of developing

manual code review is helpful, but expensive and prone to human error!

why expensive? because $1.42/minute is the cost of your dev's time!

so we want AUTOMATED tools for continous devilery

Part of that, obviously, is automated testing

basically, a dev finished their branch, merges it into the shared branch. Then the CI/CD platform is doing testing, vulnerability scan, and the push to prod

what's the point? Well, you're able to learn a lot faster if your build has issues, changes are tested and vetted every time. And release cycles go faster.
