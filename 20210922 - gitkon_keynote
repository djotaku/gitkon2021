How Git is Changing the Web

- Before git, most folks using centralized repo - SVN
    - server is single source of truth and requires a sysadmin to keep it running well
    - wouldn't use it for a hobby project because too much overhead
- git's simplicity means you can run it in nearly every folder on your computer to version your documents
- SVN rquired long-lived branches and static servers
- sites built on jekyll and ember are possible once you have git
- git's short-lived branches can work with websites - this is what Netlify does - each deploy preview has its own URL thanks to git
- a demo of how git can be used to manage websites
