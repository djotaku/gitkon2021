Building Git Velocity Metrics

Why?
    - Deliver products to customer faster
    - introduce fewer bugs
    
Want to use the DORA metrics (see previous talk today)

Git Velocity will track your DORA metrics for your project. Then you set up threshholds and it can alert you if you are missing those thresholds.

Projects are collections of repos.
