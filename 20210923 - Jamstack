Jamstack: Deploying Blazing Fast Static Sites Using Git

Static web page - delivered exactly as stored - no changes between storage and presentation to user

Dynamic web page - some generated dynamically, when needed (eg via databases)

Static web page - 
    - fast -nothing to generated
    - cheap - any server can serve it up
    - easy to maintain - just a text file
    - secure - no code executed
    - easy to scale - just need more storage
    - stable - no processes are executed, just delivering files
    
Jamstack - a way of building sites that deliver better performance, higher security, lower cost, etc

Jamstack
    - Generate static assets at build time - basically build or compile all your assets during "compile"
    - Deploy those assets to a CDN - 
    - Use Javascript to call APIs
    
Tools
    - Static Site Generator - the software that produces and deploys your site; eg Hugo (uses go), Gatsby (react), Next.js
    - Headless CMS - unlike Wordpress where you have to use PHP, the Headless CMS is one where the content repo is decoupled from the presentation layer; Storyblok is an example of a headless CMS
    - Serverless Platform - build, integrate, deploy, and host the application. When we change the code and push to github, this platform will trigger a build process to generate the static assets and host it. eg Vercel, Netlify
