Driving Jira with Git

Each Jira issue has a key

"A git commit is a process document. Developers don't like Jira. I've already left races fo my process when I pushed the code."

However, for team leads and managers, they need to look in Jira, not git. 

Why automate Jira using Git?
    - Flow - we don't want to break the dev's flow state; devs take 10-15 min to start working after an interruption
    - consistency - team feels like they're working towards the same objective - Jira is updated by all; 
    - time - team members are able to check ticket state at their own time; Also they're not interrupted. Also saves meeting time.
    
Two ways to automate:
    - smart commits
        - you use certain things in your commit like #Time #Comment or #[Transition] in your commit message and Jira updtates correctly
    - Automation for Jira
        - you don't need to remember all that syntax. Just need to use the Jira issue key.
