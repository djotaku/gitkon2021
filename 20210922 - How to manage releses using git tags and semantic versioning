How to manage releses using git tags and semantic versioning 

semantic is easy: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

PATCH = trivial change or bugfix

MINOR = functionality change, but backwards compatible

MAJOR = breaking functionality changes

Once released - version CANNOT change

As soon as you release, assume someone is using it

Since they're set in stone - combining w/ git tags is a great match!

2 kinds:
1. lightweight tag - assigned to a commit
2. annotated tags - full object in git database that is checksummed and can be signed. He says this is the one you want ot actually be using!
