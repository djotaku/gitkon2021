Don't have to make a tradeoff between speed and stability - if you have top performers they can go fast without messign up stability. Speed actually ends up being an enabler of stability.

The DORA 4

1. Lead time - how long does it take to move through the whole process

    - How long does it take from code commit to code being in production? (if there's a part after this you have no control over it, you don't count that part)
    - If you change only one line of code, what are all the steps needed to release? How long does it take?

2. Deployment frequency

    - How often is code pushed? 
    - like a muscle. The more you do it, the better the team gets at it

3. Change failure rate

    - Can you say with numerical confidence how many releases require an issue for the customer?
    
4. MTTR

    - Time to restore service when there is an incident
    
Measuring is hard. We can't improve if we can't measure it!
